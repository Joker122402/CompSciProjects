This project was to write a program that parses a data file to extract tweets, and then stores those tweets in either and Array or an Array list.

The project includes 3 classes:

#### Tweet.java
This class is responsible for the creation of Tweet objects

#### TweetLoader.java
This class is responsible for parsing the data file to extract the tweets and storing them in either an Array or an ArrayList.

#### main.java
The entrypoint for the program. Loads the tweets into both an Array and an ArrayList. Implements printHead and printTail for each type of array.
